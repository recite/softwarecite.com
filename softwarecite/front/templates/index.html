  Auto-compute Citations to Software From Replication Files
  We analyze replication files of articles in the APSR, AJPS, JoP, BJPolS, Political Analysis, World Politics, and
  Political Behavior posted to the Harvard Dataverse to tally the libraries used. This can be used as a way to calculate
  citation metrics for software.
